## Future improvements

_We recognize that building a beautiful and convincing website is not a
simple or speedy task, which is why we'd like to see what future
improvements you would suggest to get this project to a 100% production
ready state. No suggestion is a bad one, and we welcome every detail you
provide._

1-I would see if we can show a demo on the landing page, either through a stripped down version of the product, or perhaps via an iframe.

2-Implement a service like Drift, so that you can contact users while they're on your page. Studies show that contacting them within that ~minute (or less) makes further contact/interest much more likely. It also shows you're paying attention to them.

3-Include a few more testimonials, perhaps through a carousel. Showing other customers rave about your product helps build the notion that its really great.

4-Implement a service like Inspectlet so you can track user interactions and move beyond 'what' is happening to 'why' it is.
